              I'm a PhD student in the ${a(
                *.href := "https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/",
                "Systopia"
              )} and ${a(
                *.href := "https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/index.html",
                "Software Practices"
              )} labs at the University of British Columbia.
              My interests relate to programming language design in an applied context, with an ongoing focus on formal modeling languages.
              I want full-stack verified software development, from modeling the target system to dealing with performance engineering practicalities and mainenance, to be a realistic option for developers.
              That switch, between modeling concerns and implementation issues, is a particular point of friction that I'm working to alleviate.

              My work so far has been as a developer of the ${a(
                *.href := "https://github.com/DistCompiler/pgo",
                "PGo project"
              )}, a compiler for verified distributed system models.
              I am also working on a follow-up project, ${a(
                *.href := "https://github.com/DistCompiler/dcal",
                "DCal"
              )} (note: very much pre-alpha), which introduces guided term rewriting into distributed system model compilation.
              The goal is to allow a developer to explain mismatches between their model and intended working system, such that the compiler can reliably generate that intended system.
              
              You might also be interested in my work on the interface-level ${a(
                *.href := "https://github.com/tlaplus/azure-cosmos-tla/tree/master/simple-model",
                "modeling of Azure Cosmos DB in TLA+"
              )}.

              Regardless of how up to date the above ideas are, this website is a catalog of things I've built or thought about.
              This includes my research projects, talks (including video links when possible), peer-reviewed publications, and over 10 years' worth of electronic music production.

              If you're an undergraduate student reading this who wants to get involved in research, feel free to get in touch.
              We could work out some sort of collaboration, or, failing that, I could at least point you toward someone whose work might be a better fit for your interests.

              Also, check out Martin Hackett, whose paintings I used as part of this website's design.
