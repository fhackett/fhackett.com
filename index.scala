              I'm a PhD student in the ${a(
                *.href := "https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/",

                "Software Practices"
              )} labs at the University of British Columbia.
              My interests relate to programming language design in an applied context, with an ongoing focus on formal modeling languages.
              I want full-stack verified software development, from modeling the target system to dealing with performance engineering practicalities and maintenance, to be a realistic option for developers.
              That switch, between modeling concerns and implementation issues, is a particular point of friction that I'm working to alleviate.

              My work so far has been as a developer of the ${a(
                *.href := "https://github.com/DistCompiler/pgo",
                "PGo project"
              )}, a compiler for verified distributed system models (see projects page).
              I am working on a follow-up project, ${a(
                *.href := "https://github.com/DistCompiler/dcal",
                "DCal"
              )} (note: very much pre-alpha), which introduces guided term rewriting into distributed system model compilation.

              Here are also some recent internships I took part in:
